## 🤝 Group Project:
Coding project made for Code First Girls Javascript kickstarter course.
We were tasked with two weeks to produce a project using Javascript, HTML and CSS relating to food.
I worked alongsided:
- Sabrina Brown
- Antonella Lullo
- Ella Cumber
- and Simhika Rao

To create this code along with a presentation that was done to the rest of the session attendants showcasing the code working.

## 💡 How it works / the concept:
The concept is a recipe generator in which a user is on the homepage with three options:
  - meat
  - vegan/vegetarian
  - gluten free

Choosing an option leads to a popup modal coming on the screen which shows an image of a meal and a recipe link for the user to try. Hence the idea Recipe Roulette. More recipes can be added through editing the code

## 👩‍💻 To run: 
download/clone the repository and run the HTML file in your chosen browser
